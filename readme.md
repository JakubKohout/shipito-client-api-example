# Shipito client API - example of use

These scripts are example how to work with https://client-api.shipito.com.
Please edit header.php and put there your token.

Before any action you have to create session and authenticate client, you can do it by script authenticate.php. 
Please edit this file and place there real login and real password.

*DO NOT USE THESE SCRIPTS AT PRODUCTION!* These files are just examples, there are vulnerable and share same cookie. So there is always only one customer logged in.
